=== // ===
Assumptions for modeling a supply chain

modeling two types of companies.
- transformers, which transform raw materials in basic parts
- assemblers, which assemble parts into more complex parts or even final products

=== // ===
producer assember
- price is fixed, per product type
- companies produce at a fixed rate, they have to have enough supplies (raw materials)
- given a company has enough raw materials it will keep producing
- if there is no more raw materials, a company will buy products


behaviour of a producer
- starts simulation not producing anything, has to buy raw materials
- starts sim. with only TWO partners, a producer of raw materials and a client of its own products


=== // ===
producer transformer
- does not have a "input" box. only has a output box. This means that such producer only receive requests to 
build parts and can build them, not considering other input parts. 
- has a production capacity, lambda = number of parts / unit of time
