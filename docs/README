RobustWorkflows
12/03/2013

RobustWorkflows is a software emulator of agent networks. Agents are implemented as Actors and are deployed according 
to a description given by a graph. The goal of the emulator is to understand the behaviour of distributed systems
made by agents. Each agent has its own behaviour and it is quite hard to understand how a system of such agents 
behaves, since the system behaviour derives from the interaction between several agents.

Requirements
============
- MongoDB
- Java

Architecture
============
The whole system is composed by two different types of system. The first type is an application called 
"GraphLoaderApplication" which reads a graph description from a file and requests the second application type to load
 the required components (Agent actors).
 
The second application type is the "SorcererApplication", responsible for loading AgentActors as demanded.

The GraphLoaderApplication knows about the existence of all SorcerersApplications and can load balance the load of Agents 
on top of the Sorcerers. 

After the agents are loaded, the GraphLoaderApplication can just be turned off, since the agents interact independently.

There is a MongoDB to maintain the state of the infrastructure and the logs of the Model of the emulation. The infrastructure uses
the MongoDB to indicate the location of the several Sorcerers. The Agents use the MongoDB to log anything they want, and that pertains 
to the model the agents represent.
